# Adoption View

## Introduction

The Connector KIT provides a connector framework, based on the Eclipse Dataspace Connector, for sovereign, cross-enterprise data exchange.

## Vision & Mission

### Vision

We believe that sharing data along the automotive supply chain adds great value for every participant. The key to such collaboration is trust in the involved partners and assurance that the shared data is not being misused. Our vision is that in 5 years , companies along the automotive value chain will be sharing and exchanging data with each other as a matter of course, without anyone being afraid that their data will be misused. This should create added value for everyone, which only comes about through collaboration.

### Mission

With this Connector KIT we provide the single source of information and technology to perform trustful data exchange within Catena-X. The Connector KIT bundles the necessary standards, APIs, interaction patterns and reference implementations  for developers. Within the Adoption View of the Connector KIT we provide an introduction into the Connector technology and its role within Catena-X.

## Concept

Trust, interoperability, and data sovereignty, these are the objectives and values for secure and sustainable peer-to-peer data exchange between organizations and companies. The claim is data sovereignty: Whoever makes data available retains control and decides individually who is involved in the data exchange, how, when, where and under what conditions. A corresponding concept was developed in the context of Gaia-X and the International Data Space Association. __The essential software component is the connector.__
